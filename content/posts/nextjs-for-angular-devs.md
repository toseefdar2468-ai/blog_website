## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a lightweight framework built on top of React. It provides features such as:

- Server-side rendering (SSR)  
- Static site generation (SSG)  
- File-based routing  
- API routes  
- Image optimization  

Unlike Angular, Next.js is minimal and gives you freedom to structure your project however you like.
